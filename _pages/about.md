I am a final-year Bachelor's student in Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain. I am currently a Research Intern at the [Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG)](https://www.cragenomica.es/), working on the development of deep learning models with applications in plant genomics. More specifically, I am focusing on developing hybrid models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) to extract patterns of SNPs and predict quantitative traits. I am also conducting research for my Bachelor's Thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Pilar Dellunde](https://www.iiia.csic.es/es/people/person/?person_id=35), focusing on the use of fuzzy-logic operators to develop interpretable neural network models.

I have recently returned from studying at the University of Vienna for half a year, focusing mainly on Quantum Information, Complex Networks and Biomathematics (for a while, my colleague AÃ¤ron Roex and I became slightly obsessed with [extending the SIR model through Branching Processes](https://github.com/loredanasandu/sir-branching-processes)).

In my _free time_, I build stuff with a fair amount of coding, ask myself questions out of curiosity and answer them with data. I also devote time to listening to people, reading about others' insights, getting to know new places, armchair philosophy, writing, discovering new art, classical music, spending time with nature, biographies, philosophical novels, insightful conversations, great coffee, and even greater tea. Throughout my lifetime, I've learnt and continue learning voraciously about a broad range of topics including economics, contemporary history, biology, ancient Greek and Roman culture, law (and especially Roman law), Esperanto, philosophy, human behaviour, physics and artificial intelligence. I seek to continue exercising my curiosity while discovering and building new things. Also, developing my focus on things that are worth it, and trying not to let my attention span decrease.

Born in Moldova, I moved to Spain at a very early age, where I grew up.
