I am a Master's student in Computational and Mathematical Engineering at the University of Rovira i Virgili, specializing in mathematical modeling, simulation, artificial intelligence and operations research. 

I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. For my Bachelor's Thesis, I conducted research on the applications of fuzzy set theory to Explainable AI, with the supervision of [Prof. Pilar Dellunde](https://www.iiia.csic.es/es/people/person/?person_id=35) (researcher at [IIIA-CSIC](https://www.iiia.csic.es/)) and [Prof. Wolfgang Pitsch](https://mat.uab.cat/~pitsch/). I also worked as a Research Intern at the [Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics (CRAG)](https://www.cragenomica.es/), focusing on the development of deep learning models with applications in plant genomics.

During my undergraduate studies, I spent a semester at the University of Vienna, diving into Quantum Information, Complex Networks and Biomathematics (for a while, my colleague AÃ¤ron Roex and I became slightly obsessed with [extending the SIR model through Branching Processes](https://github.com/loredanasandu/sir-branching-processes)).

In my free time, I build stuff with a fair amount of coding, ask myself questions out of curiosity and answer them with data. I also devote time to listening to people, armchair philosophy, discovering new art, nature, great coffee, and learning about new technology. Throughout my lifetime, I've learnt and continue learning voraciously about a broad range of topics including economics, contemporary history, ancient Greek and Roman culture, law (and especially Roman law), Esperanto, philosophy, physics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.

Born in Moldova, I moved to Spain at a very early age and grew up there.
